# Not sure how to describe your feelings? 
Try using a feelings wheel. The feelings wheel can help you identify exactly what you are feeling and where that feeling might stem from. In my experience, being able to identify the most accurate feeling helps me be more compassionate with  myself and treat myself with more kindness.
